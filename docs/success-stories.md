## 📖 Featured Stories

### Story 1: From 50 tps to 200 tps - 4x Improvement

**Reader**: Zhang Wei, CTO at a AI Startup
**Chapter Applied**: Chapter 5 - Request Scheduling
**Problem**:
> "We were running Llama-3-70B for our chatbot, but users were experiencing slow responses. Our throughput was only 50 tokens per second, and latency was terrible."

**Solution**:
> "After reading Chapter 5, I realized we were using a simple FIFO scheduler. I implemented continuous batching and priority scheduling. Took me about 2 hours to modify our vLLM configuration."

**Results**:
- **Throughput**: 50 → 200 tps (4x improvement)
- **Latency**: P95 from 800ms to 210ms
- **Cost**: No additional hardware needed
- **Time to implement**: 2 hours

**Key Learning**:
> "I always thought batching meant fixed batch sizes. The concept of continuous batching was a game-changer for us."

### Story 2: Running 70B Model on a Single 24GB GPU

**Reader**: Sarah Chen, ML Engineer
**Chapter Applied**: Chapter 2 - GPU Basics + Chapter 6 - Quantization
**Problem**:
> "We only had RTX 4090s (24GB) and needed to run Llama-3-70B. Everyone told us we needed A100s."

**Solution**:
> "Chapter 2 taught me how to calculate memory requirements. Chapter 6 showed me AWQ quantization. I used 4-bit quantization and optimized the KV cache. It actually worked!"

**Results**:
- **Model**: Llama-3-70B (4-bit)
- **Memory Usage**: 22 GB / 24 GB
- **Performance**: Slightly slower than FP16 but 4x cheaper
- **Savings**: $10,000+ on GPU costs

**Key Learning**:
> "I used to think more VRAM was always better. Now I understand bandwidth and quantization trade-offs."

### Story 3: Reducing Cloud Costs by 60%

**Reader**: Michael Rodriguez, Freelance Developer
**Chapter Applied**: Chapter 8 - Production Deployment
**Problem**:
> "My client was paying $2,000/month for GPU instances. They wanted to reduce costs but couldn't sacrifice performance."

**Solution**:
> "I used the monitoring and profiling techniques from Chapter 8. Found that we were over-provisioning. Implemented auto-scaling and spot instances. The deployment chapter's Kubernetes configs were exactly what I needed."

**Results**:
- **Monthly cost**: $2,000 → $800 (60% reduction)
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime maintained
- **Client satisfaction**: "This is amazing"

**Key Learning**:
> "Production deployment is about more than just code. Monitoring, autoscaling, and cost optimization matter just as much."
