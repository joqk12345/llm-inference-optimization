## 🚀 Step 1: Create GitHub Repository (5 minutes)

### Option A: Using GitHub CLI (Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /Users/mac/Documents/workspace/Data/01_Work/Projects/book-craft

# Initialize git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: LLM Inference Optimization book

- Complete README with project overview
- Chapter 2: GPU Basics (3000+ words)
- Code examples with Docker setup
- Contribution guidelines
- Community templates (FAQ, contributors, success stories)"

# Create repository on GitHub
gh repo create llm-inference-optimization \
  --public \
  --description "A practical guide to optimizing LLM inference - from GPU basics to production deployment" \
  --source=. \
  --remote=origin \
  --push

# Your repository is now live at:
# https://github.com/joqk12345/llm-inference-optimization
```

### Option B: Manual GitHub Creation

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `llm-inference-optimization`
3. Description: `A practical guide to optimizing LLM inference - from GPU basics to production deployment`
4. Set to **Public**
5. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"
7. Push your code:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/joqk12345/llm-inference-optimization.git

  ```markdown
  Hi HN,

  I'm writing a practical guide to LLM inference optimization.

  Why: ChatGPT is fast, but running LLMs locally is slow. I spent a year
  researching vLLM and optimization techniques. Now I'm sharing what I learned.

  What: Free book covering GPU basics, KV cache, scheduling, quantization,
  speculative sampling, and production deployment.

  Target: Developers who know Python but no deep learning background required.

  Status: Just launched with Chapter 2 complete. Planning to finish all 9 chapters
  in 5 months.

  90% will be free. The book includes code examples with Docker setup.

  GitHub: https://github.com/joqk12345/llm-inference-optimization

  Feedback welcome!
  ```
